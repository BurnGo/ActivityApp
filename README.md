# ActivityApp
An application that encourages movement and motivates users not only to be active, but also to contribute to preserving and expanding the Earth's resources. 

## Introduction
Only 54% of Lithuanian students spend 30 minutes walking (Health of Population of Lithuania, 2020) to gain physical stamina and improve their health. To educate a larger part of the student audience to live an active and healthy lifestyle, we developed a movement app called PlanetGo. This app stands out from the competition by its willingness to create a consumer attitude towards a healthier lifestyle and the preservation of the Earth's natural resources.

## Product owners
The application was created by a team of 6 Kaunas university of technology students for module PR00B251 "Product development project". Our team consisted of 3 Software Developers, Data Scientist, Financial Analyst and a Marketing Specialist. Alongside the app we also wrote an extensive report which consisted of an Introduction, Projects idea and preparations, Product development concept (analysis of the macro environment, consumer survey, consumer, competitor, supplier, financial, technological analyses), Product testing and much more.

## The Application
The app is developed using the Android Studio platform and the Kotlin programming language. Step tracking uses the built-in step tracker on mobile devices to ensure accurate step detection. The map is implemented using Google Maps API, 2 out of 5 points on the map are randomly generated, and the rest of the points are selected from our database, where we keep the most visited places in Kaunas city and user data. The database server is built using the Azure platform, and the database queries are processed using the PHP programming language. We also managed to implement help, user settings pages, statistical indicators such as: calories burned, CO2 saved, etc. During the semester we came up with ideas to implement a virtual tree, a leaderboard. Growing of the tree requires coins, which are randomly obtained while using the app by arriving at the points shown on the map. After "fertilizing" and "watering" the sapling 4 times each, the next stage of the sapling is reached. The leaderboard shows the top 5 users who have walked the most steps that week, and the user can also see their position in the leaderboard. The main, login and registration windows have also been implemented. In order to generate revenue for the app, we have implemented a paid statistics window, where the user can see even more various statistics and graphs.
